I started with very simple prompts to learn HTML5 box model, CSS and Javascript. Then after a few years of prompt engineering I wanted to make beats start to finish on my chromebook, but there was no easily found apps for this. Then I started making simple micro daws with Web Audio API, and it led to the Omikuji Sample Sequencer, Another app I made and use alot is the SP-224 Pitch Shifter. these are linked below to live demos.
